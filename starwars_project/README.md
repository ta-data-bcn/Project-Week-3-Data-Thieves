## Project Description
Searched for lots of topics but decided to do something different. Found lots of information about Star Wars Univers and its characters so decided to create a "Tinder" of Star Wars. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
Characters
- Male, female, robot distribution
- Species distribution
- Who speaks more by gender
- Tinder for species
    - Search for mean, median and distribution for height, eye colour of each species
    - Search for most talkative characters - How much people talk in each film in each planet

Planets
- lanet distribution
- lanets by film

Vehicles
- The most popular vehicles and starships that appears in most movies
- Film containing the most expensive starships
- The most efficient starship in the starwars series according to a coefficient devised by us

## Dataset

API: https://swapi.co/
Web Scrapping: https://www.latimes.com/projects/star-wars-most-talkative-characters/

## Database
In first instance we wanted to create a more clean structure, but because of luck on time we end up creating a "simple" structure.

## Workflow
- search for an idea to work on
- search for data about that idea
- (repeat until there is enough data)
- search what kind of information the data has
- brainstorm questions
- see the orientation of the questions we most liked
- second brainstorm once there is a general idea of what to do
- recover data and store it
- clear and relate the data
- answer questions
- see the results and try to validate if they were what expected or not
- obtain figures to present results
- prepare presentation
- talk about how to present the presentation

## Organization
there are two main folders:
- data: contains data information
    - csv: contains all csv files recovered and created from the different sources
    - sql: DB structure/content and some queries we used to test how to recover information
- starwars_project: python and jupyter notebook files to search and transform the data
