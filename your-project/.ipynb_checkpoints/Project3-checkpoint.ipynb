    "Humans where once fairly harmless and peaceful (minus some animal killing, and some human killing and well a lot of killing but yeah, you get the point) but then, somehow (ehem colonialism and industrial revolution) they became LETHAL!!! at least to many other species (we have always been lethal towards our own).\n",

    "Over the milenia Earth has experienced many cyclic changes including climate variation and its consequent temperature fluctuation (glacial advance and retreat). The end of last Ice Age allowed us to thrive so yeah to climate change!! But is this temperature change all part of Earth's plan? or are humans responsible for this? Climate change is very real and facts show that Earth's plan was not having all this tiny humans messing around. So, let us stop with all the babling and start seeing some facts.\n"

    "For this project, APIs and web scrapping were initially the main resources to obtain information. Nonetheless, API access was complicated and obtaining tokens proved to be a challange that could not be successfully completed. Web scrapping on the other hand, was very useful to gather initial data to have a general idea about what to do, but useless due to lack of common variables.  At the end, csv datasets were the main source of information.\n",

    "- There is a clear increasing trend in human population that keeps growing over the years at a quite similar percentage. The acumulated increase percentatge since 1996 until now is 28â€™5%\n",
    "- It seems that it was not until 2010 that temperature increasing was a lot more accused, reaching almost 1 degree of difference. It might seem like nothing to us but it is in fact very dangerous for other species.\n",
    "- It seems that overall, the most threatened species are plants, then vertebrates and then invertebrates. It was hypothesised that plants would be the most affected ones, which they are but it was also hypothesised that invertebrates would be more affected than vertebrates, which they are not. Possible reason could be peaching, sport hunting or less adaptability to changes that result in vertebrates being more threatened. Further research needs to be carried in order to confirm those ideas.\n",
    "- On one hand the threatened species increase over the years but on the other hand the index (threatened/assessed) diminishes starting on the year 2002 indicating that each year more species have been assessed, possibly due to at least scientific awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The three variables that were analysed are evolving together in a similar trend but it is difficult to say whether they are directly correlated or not since there are many other variables that should be controled to obtain reliable conclusions. Therefore the first and second hypothesis can be accepted taking on account that is not a undoubtful correlation but more of a similar evolutionary trend."
