## Project Description
Our project consists of analysing the impact of COVID-19 in terms of cases, deaths and testing and how this has impacted global markets. We prepared and carried out an analysis between two data sources using Pandas and Matplotlib visualization tools in Python. 
<!--- wherever we could successfully analyse and visualize the data from our chosen sources. -->

## Questions & Hypotheses
Our hypothesis is that the Coronavirus would have distinct effects on the Global Market. Particuarly, we wanted to see how the number of total cases related to changes in the market. Do they coincide or is there a delay? Additionally, we wanted to investigate how Coronavirus numbers changed overtime globally and in specific countries. As we investigated the data, we were presented with more questions to ask. 

## Dataset
Databases used: [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/API,Documentation/view/v1/) and [WHO CSV COVID19 Datasets](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).

## Database
We decided that creating a database was not nessecary in our case as we were able to manipulate our datasets easily in Pandas and JupyterNotebooks.
Both datasets were aligned by dates, allowing an easy link between them.

## Workflow
Our workflow was mapped out using Trello in order to keep track of our tasks and goals. We communicated via Slack and Zoom to discuss and share data. 
We also collated our data into one uniform JupyterNotebook, which we have subsequently shown in the form of a paper. 

<!--- We organised the work using Trello and with GitHub. file share our latest figures while -->
## Organization
We organized our remote work in a collaborated GitHub repository. Files such as images and notebooks were saved to seperate folders in order to ensure we didn't overwrite each other's data. In addition, we prepared a presentation in a shared Google slides showing the data analysis process and data visualizations. Finally, the JupyterNotebook's were merged and then uploaded into the main "your-code" file.
