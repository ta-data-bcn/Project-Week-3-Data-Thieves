## Project Description

We are interested in understanding the influence of Western governments in international finance and public opinion. Who is more influenced nowadays? Do they affect each other? Since this is a wide and complex topic, we narrow it down to an observation of the characters that have caused great global turnmoil in the last decade: Wall Street & Trump.

## Questions & Hypotheses

- How does Wall Street affect Trump's popularity (and what does he have to say about it)?
- How do Trump's tweets affect Wall Street?

## Dataset

## Organization

We used a Trello board to organize ourselves. Mostly, we divided the work on the data obtention and cleaning between the members of our groups and the topics on which we needed said data. Afterwards, we came together and discussed the main insights, ploted and stablished our conclusions and way to present them.
